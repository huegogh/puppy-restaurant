You will upload it to your web server and put the link in a text document.
That text document needs to be included with your project and other files when you upload your assignment here.
Your Project must be using GitHub and you need to make sure each person has their own branch. Also be sure to include your Git Hub Link.
This is a group project, so you will submit a 1 page document talking about your experience with your group and an evaluation on each person in your group.
You will also make sure you have at least 90% accessibility on your site.
